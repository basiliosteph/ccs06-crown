In Chapter 4, Eadlyn is happy to see that she has received some good 
press in the newspaper the next morning. She discusses the article with 
her mother and father and then attends her Finnish class. She partners 
with Kile, and they chat about their past and present relationship. 
Eadlynâ€™s attention returns to class when she sees Erik looking at them. 
After class, Eadlyn goes to her office. Lady Brice is there and informs 
Eadlyn about the coronation plans, suggesting that Neena help her with 
the plans and tells Eadlyn that while Marid will be attending, his parents 
will not. Lady Brice suggests that Eadlyn focus on spending one-on-one 
time with the Elite.
