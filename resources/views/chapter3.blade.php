In Chapter 3, the Elite are eating a meal. The seating arrangement 
makes Eadlyn sad because her parents’ seats sit empty at the head of the 
table. Erik notices the change in her disposition. Looking into his eyes 
gives her the strength to make a move. Eadlyn changes the seating 
arrangement and afterwards announces that the suitors will have Finnish 
lessons. Everyone is happy, and Henri toasts Eadlyn.

In the next part of the chapter, Eadlyn reads the newspaper and gets the 
impression that the public did not listen to the Elite. Instead, they focus 
on the elimination and Gunner’s absence. Marid’s picture is also situated 
next to hers. Lady Brice advises Eadlyn to focus on what she can 
accomplish. She says that Eadlyn must choose a husband. Neena is there, 
and they discuss the Elite.
