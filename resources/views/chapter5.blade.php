In Chapter 5, Eadlyn does the interview with Marid. Afterwards she 
scolds him for once again giving the appearance that he has feelings for 
her. Marid threatens her by saying that he is more popular than she is. 
Marid asserts that he is the one who makes her look good. If she does not 
end the Selection and marry him, Marid threatens to make the public 
think that their first impression of her was correct. She promises to ruin 
him, but Marid says that the people will turn on her if she does. After he 
leaves, Eadlyn thinks of all of the people she misjudged and wonders who 
else falls into the same category. She then runs into Erik. She takes him 
to the Womenâ€™s Room and asks if he feels the same way about her as she 
does about him.
